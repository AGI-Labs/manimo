# MANIMO

A modular interface for robotic manipulation:
1. supports a suite of sensors (camera sensors, force sensors, touch sensors, audio sensors) and actuators (robotic arms: panda, and end-effectors).
2. allows users to compose different sensor modalities and actuators to form new manipulation environments. (mujoco compatible envs)
3. allows users to collect demonstrations from the created manipulation environments through
  a. teleoperation (VR, space mouse)
  b. manual control

## Future:

1. supports on-board calbiration of different sensors.
