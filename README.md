# MANIMO

A modular interface for robotic manipulation:
1. supports a suite of sensors (camera sensors, force sensors, touch sensors, audio sensors) and actuators (robotic arms: panda, and end-effectors).
2. allows users to compose different sensor modalities and actuators to form new manipulation environments. (mujoco compatible envs)

## Future:
1. allows users to collect demonstrations from the created manipulation environments through
  a. teleoperation (VR, space mouse)
  b. manual control
2. supports on-board calbiration of different sensors.
